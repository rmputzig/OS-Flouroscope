OS-Flouroscope
==============

Open Source Flouroscope
This is a modification to the MOST Delta printer that turns it into a flouroscope. The printhead is replaced with a holder for a sensor and LED that is moved over a sample by the printer.
The data is then recorded on an SD Card using an Arduino. The LED is easily swapable, allowing for different wavelengths to tested. 

More details will be posted as they became available.
